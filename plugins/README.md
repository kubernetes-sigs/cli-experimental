# cli-experimental kubectl plugins

These plugins simulate functionality that sig-cli is considering for inclusion
in kubectl proper. Simulating this functionality using plugins makes it easier
for users to experiment and provide feedback.

This is not intended to be a long term repository for plugins. Once sig-cli
reaches a decision about the functionality provided in a plugin, it should
either be merged into kubectl or become a standalone plugin in a separate
repository.
