recurring issues and historical decisions. 


## Enhancing kubectl create/run

TODO: Condense [PR#914](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/914)

## kubectl get all

`kubectl get all` is a legacy command and is actually implemented with a
hardcoded server side list that is not easy to maintain. There is potential that
it will be removed in the future and therefore will not be expanded upon or
improved.

Associated issue: [ISSUE#151](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/151)

We recommend using [ketall](https://github.com/corneliusweig/ketall) which can
be installed standalone or via [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/).

## Confirmation when using `--all`

Introducing `--all` would be a breaking change. We’ve made an attempt in the
past (see [PR#62167](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62167)) and we’ve decided
that the suggested approach is to encourage cluster owners to implement
something like [PR#17740](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/17740) or currently
using validating webhooks (check [here](
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#validatingwebhookconfiguration-v1-admissionregistration-k8s-io))
but no such effort will be undertaken in kubectl itself.

## Supported versions

The Kubernetes project maintains release branches for the most recent three
minor releases (1.19, 1.18, 1.17 as of this writing). [Kubernetes Version Skew
