{{< alert color="success" title="TL;DR" >}}
- [krew.sigs.k8s.io](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) is a kubernetes sub-project to discover and manage plugins
{{< /alert >}}

# Krew

By design, `kubectl` does not install plugins. This task is left to the kubernetes sub-project
[krew.sigs.k8s.io](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) which needs to be installed separately.
Krew helps to

- discover plugins
- get updates for installed plugins
- remove plugins

## Installing krew

Krew should be used as a kubectl plugin. To set yourself up to using krew - please check out the [Installation section for krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/)
