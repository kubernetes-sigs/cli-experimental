- Format and print specific fields from Resources
- Use when scripting with Get

# Print Resource Fields

## Motivation

Kubectl Get is able to pull out fields from Resources it queries and format them as output.

This may be **useful for scripting or gathering data** about Resources from a Kubernetes cluster.

## Get

The `kubectl get` reads Resources from the cluster and formats them as output.  The examples in
this chapter will query for Resources by providing Get the *Resource Type* with the
Version and Group as an argument.
For more query options see [Queries and Options](/guides/resource_printing/queries_and_options/).

Kubectl can format and print specific fields from Resources using Json Path.

By default, if no API group or version is specified, kubectl will use the group and version preferred by
the apiserver.

Because the **Resource structure may change between API groups and Versions**, users *should* specify the
API Group and Version when emitting fields from `kubectl get` to make sure the command does not break
in future releases.

Failure to do this may result in the different API group / version being used after a cluster upgrade, and
this group / version may have changed the representation of fields.

***Example:*** Print the JSON representation of the first Deployment in the list on a single line
```bash
kubectl get deployment.v1.apps -o=jsonpath='{.items[0]}{"\n"}'
```

you get:
```bash
map[apiVersion:apps/v1 kind:Deployment...replicas:1 updatedReplicas:1]]
```

This ideology can be extended to query out the specific fields in a yaml resource file.
