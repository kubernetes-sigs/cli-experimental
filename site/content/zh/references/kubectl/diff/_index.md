    diffs the online configuration with local config

Diff configurations specified by filename or stdin between the current online configuration, and the configuration as it would be if applied.

Output is always YAML.

```yaml
# deployment.yaml - local configuration

## Generating a Diff

Use the `diff` program in a user's path to display a diff of the changes that will be
made by Apply.

```sh
kubectl diff -k ./dir/
```

## Setting the Diff Program

The `KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF` environment variable can be used to select your own diff command.
By default, the "diff" command available in your path will be run with "-u" (unified) and "-N"
(treat new files as empty) options.

```sh
export KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF=meld; kubectl diff -k ./dir/
```
