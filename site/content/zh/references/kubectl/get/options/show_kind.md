**Note:** This can be useful if the user did not specify the group in the command and
they want to know which API is being used.

kubectl get deployments --show-kind
```

### Output
```bash
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.extensions/nginx   1         1         1            1           8m
```
