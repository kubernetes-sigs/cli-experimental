    Add labels and selectors to add all resources.
---

Add labels and selectors to all resources.  If the label key already is present on the resource,
the value will be overridden.

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
Selectors for resources such as Deployments and Services shouldn't be changed once the
resource has been applied to a cluster.

Changing commonLabels to live resources could result in failures.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

commonLabels:
  someName: someValue
  owner: alice
  app: bingo
```

## Example

### File Input
