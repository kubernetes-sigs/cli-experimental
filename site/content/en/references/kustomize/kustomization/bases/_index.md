{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
The `bases` field was deprecated in v2.1.0
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Move entries into the [resources](/references/kustomize/resource)
field.  This allows bases - which are still a
[central concept](/references/kustomize/glossary#base) - to be
ordered relative to other input resources.
